[PickUp Patrol](https://www.pickuppatrol.net/) (we call it PUP for short) is a SaaS company that I founded in high school. It’s since grown into a small business that is used by hundreds of schools internationally to manage the attendance and dismissal process.

The story behind the company is probably not what you have in mind when you hear "SaaS tech startup", so I'm going to start this story talking about legos but I swear it's relevant, just stick with me.

Growing up I did [FIRST Lego League (FLL)](https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/fll/), where teams build robots out of legos to complete a set of challenges. I was on the NXTreme Team, we competed for four years and did pretty well. Unironically I think my greatest achievement is winning 1st place for programming at the world championships in 2012. I keep the trophy in my office (it's made of legos and it's very cool).

But a lesser known part of FLL is the project portion, which has nothing to do with robots and involves solving a problem in your community. There's a lot to it but essentially a good project needs to:

1. Identify a problem in your community.
2. Come up with a solution.
3. Present the solution to an expert, or the community.

The FLL theme for the year when we started was transportation, so we brainstormed ways that transportation could be done better. We must've come up with at least 50 ideas, but after narrowing it down we eventually came up with an idea that would become a business.

We were all in elementary school and had experienced going home on the wrong bus or forgetting we were supposed to go to an after-school event. We thought there was a better way to manage it all.

We sketched out the idea for PUP, which would be a computer system that completely automated a school's dismissal process. Most schools currently use a complex series of handwritten notes and lists to figure out where all the children are going at the end of the day, which we knew from experience wasn't the most reliable.

But PUP automates all of this. If a child needs to go home on a different bus, or is being picked up by someone else, the parent enters the plan change on the app or website. The office staff, teacher, and bus driver will automatically be notified of the change at the end of the day via email.

We put together our presentation, which was a Harry Potter themed puppet show about the troubles of school dismissal because we were obsessed with this [one youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx1XIm6q4r4) at the time. So all that was left was to present to the community.

We decided to show it to our school board. For reasons that I still don't fully understand, after seeing the puppet show, our principal asked us if we could actually make it. And us, a bunch of 5th graders whose only experience with programming was lego robots and messing around with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) in the computer lab on Thursdays, agreed to produce enterprise software for our school district.

On every level this was going to be a train wreck but thankfully my dad is an actual software engineer and walked us through it. To be honest, we didn't know what we were doing and really just helped with some of the UI. That first iteration of PUP was almost entirely written by him while waiting for us in the parking lot of the local karate studio. Thanks dad <3

So we gave PUP version 0 to the school, and it worked pretty well. So well, that the other schools in our district wanted it too. A lot had to be refactored since we hadn't imagined more than one school would ever use the system, but we got there eventually.

Then we started hearing from other districts, and they said they were willing to pay for it. We had to start saying no for liability reasons, also my dad had a real job and there wasn't anyone to maintain it.

But when the NXTreme Team members were in sophomore year we realized we were onto something with PUP. There was a big meeting and we decided to incorporate as PickUp Patrol LLC. We joined a startup accelerator and the code was rebuilt from the ground up to be in the cloud so it could be way more scalable and secure.

The company has changed a lot over the years, but the product has stayed basically unchanged since that initial presentation. The company is still going strong over 10 years later. I started to step away from the company during college to focus on classes and internships, but I'm really grateful to have worked on it with everyone <3
