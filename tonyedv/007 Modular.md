Functions to graphs
Funcgraph?
Funcygraphs?

I was bored in math class, so I did more exciting math, drawing out all the charts. I tried a couple functions and noticed some looked similar, it became clear that 2n mod p-1 is isomorphic to n^2 mod p, but only when p is prime. 

This, was super interesting, and the first time I got really excited about pure math. The structure was so obvious, but the mechanics were not. And it only working when p is prime made it even more mysterious.

I worked on this for a very very long time, whenever I was bored in math class. I even put coming up with a proof on my bucket list.

Here’s the solution I came up with




I often got bored in math classes during college. I had taken some of the more advanced classes in high school, and so often we'd cover material that was review for me. I'd often doodle or sketch to kill the time. At one point I was messing around with drawing functions as graphs. Here is what one of those sketches would look like for `f(n) = 2n`

Each number is a node, and there's a directed edge going from `n` to `f(n)` for all natural numbers. In a sense, this graph is what doubling whole numbers looks like. Doubling 1 takes you to 2, doubling two gives 4, etc. There's an infinite number of chains of infinite length, so I'm just showing a couple nodes for simplicity.

Because the chains are infinitely long, it's hard to work with them, and unsatisfying to draw them. So, I thought it would be more fun to use modular arithmetic to keep things finite. Here is the graph of `2n mod 10`, which is my personal favorite.

This looked kind of neat, so I started drawing more, I tried different mods to see how it impacts the shape, here's `2n mod 1` through `2n mod 10`

After the graphs started getting too big to easily draw (mod 30 was around the most I could manage before it got too tedious) I looked at slight variations, like `2n + 1` or `3n`. One of the variations I tried was `n^2`, which looked like this:

When drawing `n^2 mod 11`, it became obvious that there was something interesting going on. The graph for `n^2 mod 11` was remarkably similar to `2n mod 10`. I also noted the same between `n^2 mod 7` and `2n mod 6` , as well as `n^2 mod 5` and `2n mod 4`. I came up with the following conjecture.

> The function graph generated by n^2 mod p (ignoring the node for 0) is isomorphic to the function graph generated by 2n mod p-1 where p is any prime.

This became my go-to problem, I would think about why these two functions had similar structures often, and I would try to come up with a proof for it.

Admittedly, I’m not a mathematician, and I’m sure there are tried and tested methods for making these kinds of proofs, but I intentionally didn’t seek them out. After all, the goal wasn’t to prove it as fast as possible, it was to kill time.
