I often got bored in math classes during college. I had taken some of the more advanced classes in high school, and so often we'd cover material that was review for me. So I would do a lot of doodling and sketching to kill the time. At one point I was messing around with drawing functions as graphs. Here is what one of those sketches would look like for `f(n) = 2n`

Each number is a node, and there's a directed edge going from `n` to `f(n)` for all natural numbers. In a sense, this graph is what doubling whole numbers looks like. Doubling 1 takes you to 2, doubling 2 gives 4, etc. There's an infinite number of chains of infinite length, so I'm just showing a couple nodes for simplicity.

Because the chains are infinitely long, it's kind of boring and not very satisfying to draw. So, I thought it would be more fun to use modular arithmetic to keep things finite. Here is the graph of `2n mod 10`, which is my personal favorite.

This looked kind of neat, so I started drawing more, I tried different mods to see how it impacts the shape, here's `2n mod 1` through `2n mod 10`

After the graphs started getting too big to easily draw (mod 30 was around the most I could manage before it got too tedious) I looked at slight variations, like `2n + 1` or `3n`. One of the variations I tried was `n^2`, which looked like this:

When drawing `n^2 mod 11`, it became obvious that there was something interesting going on. The graph for `n^2 mod 11` was remarkably similar to `2n mod 10`. I also noted the same between `n^2 mod 7` and `2n mod 6` , as well as `n^2 mod 5` and `2n mod 4`. I came up with the conjecture:

> The function graph generated by n^2 mod p (ignoring the node for 0) is isomorphic to the function graph generated by 2n mod p-1 where p is any prime.

This became my go-to problem, I would think about why these two functions had similar structures often, and I would try to come up with a proof for it.

Admittedly, I’m not a mathematician, and I’m sure there are tried and tested methods for making these kinds of proofs, but I didn't want any spoilers so I was going to do this with no formal background in number theory.
